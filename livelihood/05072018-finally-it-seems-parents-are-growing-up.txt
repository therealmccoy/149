The trend of students scoring high marks in Class 10 opting only for science courses for Plus Two admissions is slowly changing.

More number of students with A+ in all subjects are now preferring humanities courses as their first option, claim teachers in Kozhikode district.

This changing trend could be attributed to the increasing awareness among parents and students about the possibilities of pursuing higher studies in social sciences. Engineering courses had lost their sheen too.

“It is a fact that students want to move away from traditional courses. And parents are respecting their choices. For example, there is an integrated five-year programme at the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras in social science. Many of our students are planning to join that course. There are many other similar courses in universities outside the State,” he said.
