The FSSAI as part of its ‘Eat Healthy movement’ has asked all restaurants to voluntarily display the calories per dish on the menu. Also, to promote healthy eating habits, it has asked eateries to reduce the quantity of salt, sugar and fat (in the form of unsaturated edible oils) in the food served.

On July 10, India’s regulatory authority FSSAI, the food industry, public health professionals, civil society and consumer organisations, met in New Delhi to chalk out ways to improve public health, under the ‘The Eat Right Movement. 

FSSAI officials asked food businesses to reformulate their products and provide nutritional information to consumers.

In the food services sector, restaurants should provide healthier food options and must introduce menu-labelling, the statement read.
