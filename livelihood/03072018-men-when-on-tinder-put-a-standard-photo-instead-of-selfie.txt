*Upfront*: A study of 230 active social media users, published in the Health Communication journal, looking at the relationship between online health content and the impact it has on those who view it, with selfies in particular negatively impacting the receiver.

*Background*: Another survey of over 1000 people by AskMen, which was conducted in honour of last month’s National Selfie Day, respondents said that selfies were the absolute worst ‘category’ of photo, even more off putting than food snaps, baby photos, and engagement posts. In fact 80 per cent of people surveyed suggested that they’d prefer a standard photo over the selfie.

*Gospel*: People who are exposed to a higher number of ‘fitspo’ selfies were more likely to experience moments of low self-esteem and were overly concerned with their weight and visual appearance.

*Your Take?*: What are you going to do?
