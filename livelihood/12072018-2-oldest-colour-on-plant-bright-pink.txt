Scientists claim to have found the oldest colour ever discovered.

The historic hue – which is 1.1 billion years old and was found in rocks deep beneath the Sahara desert – has been described as bright pink.

The molecules are around half a billion years older than any pigments found before, according to scientists. They are the remains of molecules that exist even before animals were around.

"The bright pink pigments are the molecular fossils of chlorophyll that were produced by ancient photosynthetic organisms inhabiting an ancient ocean that has long since vanished," said Nur Gueneli from the ANU Research School of Earth Sciences.

Scientists found the pigments deep beneath the Sahara. It crushed the billion-year-old rocks to powder, then extracted and analysed the ancient molecules inside.
