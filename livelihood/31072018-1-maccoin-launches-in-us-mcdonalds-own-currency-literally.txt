The story:
On Thursday ie 2nd of August 2018, to commemorate the Big Mac's 50th anniversary, McDonald across it's 14,000 restaurants in US would give 1 MacCoin on every Big Mac purchase. And customers can redeem those coins in lieu of another free Big Mac, starting from 3rd of August till the end of 2018.
The coins are brass coloured and Thursday has been chosen as the launch date because it coincides with the 100th birthday of Mr. Jim Delligatti, a McDonald franchise in Western Pennsylvania , who invented the Big Mac.

"Why" this story:
We are living in an age when there is almost a new crypto-currency being launched everyday, there has been never more interest in general public sphere how to free the entire "exchange of value" system from tyrannical hands of governments and central banks, who have been the sole issuer of currency so far.

The Perspective:
Since currency is just a medium, to exchange of value, and hence any entity who can be trusted enough, can issue its/her/his currency; prima facie. And in today's world there is more trusts on some of the big name private entities with whom we put the faith of our food, health, kids, entertainment and livelihood. These entities do not have any sovereign backing for their trust, but the goodwill which they have generated over the years act as their gold reserve.

Thus it makes perfect sense, for such entities to launch some or other form of currency, to encash their goodwill. For example, McDonald sold 1.3 Billion Big Mac last year, it is such a huge reservoir of trust which lies un-cashed.

"What" of this story:
What do you think are some of the names in India, which can launch their own currency of MacCoin form?
