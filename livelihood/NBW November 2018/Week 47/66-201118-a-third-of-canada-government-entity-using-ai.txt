Indian government is still stuck at least 5 years behind in the myriad confines of 'Digital India' and almost defunct 'Startup India'. There are however far more progressive governments. Those who have already embraced artificial intelligence and related technology in a big way.

Canada government's almost one-third of entities have already adopted artificial intelligence in some or other way. Altogether, the Canadian government has spent more than $8.4 million since 2015 in acquiring these capabilities.

"At $4.3 million, the Canada Revenue Agency has spent the most, at least from Nov. 4, 2015, to Sept. 18, 2018 — the dates its entities reported on.

Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) and Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) were also big spenders. They spent more than $1 million each for various types of AI, including “chatbots.”

ESDC has used free open-source chatbots, but also spent $466,750 on another version of the technology.

IRCC bought its own for $150,442, but says its version of the software is capable of understanding complex questions and responding to several , in real time, at all times."

Indian government now in it's fag end of current term need to show it's resolve to 'Vikas' by adopting new technologies which are rapidly changing the world. It however seems less likely when next half odd years seems to be over-taken with bitter rival political blood-bath. The casualty would be India, because six months matter a lifetime, when a new industrial revolution is unfolding.
