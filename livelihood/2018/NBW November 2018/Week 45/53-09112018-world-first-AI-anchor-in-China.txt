AI entered in the world of 'news' long ago, with automatic 'news summary' creation. But who would have thought that it would soon enter into realms of 'in-person' news delivery also.

In a world, where news channel rule the roost, because of the unique and signature way of delivery of content, why would someone listen to a robotic voice? 

But there must have been enough valid reasons for China's news agency, Xinhua to work on one such AI driven robotic news anchor.

And the reason is like always, to drive down the production cost. An anchor which could be omni present, 24X7 without any fatigue.

World's first artificial intelligence (AI) news anchor introduced itself, at the ongoing fifth World Internet Conference in east China's Zhejiang Province.

The news anchor, dressed up with latest AI technology, has a male image with a voice, facial expressions and actions of a real person. 

"He" learns from live broadcasting videos by himself and can read texts as naturally as a professional news anchor.

The AI news anchor was developed by Xinhua News Agency, the official state-run media outlet of China, and Chinese search engine company Sogou.com.

According to Xinhua, "he" has become a member of its reporting team and can work 24 hours a day on its official website and various social media platforms, reducing news production costs and improving efficiency.

While the robot can read the texts as a human anchor, but what makes news 'news' is not only the content but it's delivery with emotions. People do not throng to news channels, they throng to their favourite news anchor. In such realms, how enduring a robot can make itself to the audiences remains to be seen. More so, when people know that they are listening to a robot news anchor.

Gone are the days when news anchor used to compete with each other, now they have AI robots for company.
