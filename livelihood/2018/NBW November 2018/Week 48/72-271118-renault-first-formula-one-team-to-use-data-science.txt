In God we trust, rest all others must come with data. Anyone who said that, must have the formula one racers in mind.
In a game where seconds don't matter, where microseconds matter, the drivers listen to either their instinct or gut and God.

It is very difficult to convince these demi-Gods, if a change is required.

Some time there are discrepancies between driver’s feedback and what the data shows. In such case it becomes very difficult to decide who is speaking the truth, the 'man in the arena' or data.

Formula One racing is the most egotistical sport. Defined by strong individuals. It becomes difficult to take decisions, unless the 'petrolheads' are convinced.

Renault has partnered with Microsoft since 2012. The company provides the racing team with crucial software and cloud computing services. It has also started the 'data science department' and is the first team in sports to establish such a faculty.

"At Renault’s UK factory, over 60 terabytes of data are generated each week by a group of supercomputers used to simulate races.

According to the team, it produces 1.5 billion race strategy simulations per season, and over 90,000 simulated outcomes per lap each weekend. “You have to make the most of the data, making sure you have proper modelling and simulation, optimisation and capacity.”

It would help in changing the strategy and winning, but the new data-science department at Renault would also bring a lot of credibility to 'data' itself. 

In a world where the data is king, it is not only about having it but also presenting it with right perspective, so that right people can see and listen to it and adapt. Changing the mind after all requires a lot of convincing power.

“They understand the world in which we live and are extremely knowledgeable about data … and sometimes they are capable of changing their own minds, their own feedback, just by looking at that data.”

Where data fails, data-science team succeeds.
