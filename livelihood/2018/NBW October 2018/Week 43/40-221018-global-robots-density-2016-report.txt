International Federation of Robotics (IFR),  is a professional non-profit organization. It promotes the robotics industry. The organisation has calculated 'average robot density' worldwide.  The density is accelerating globally.

Robot density is an excellent standard to compare the differences in the automation degree of the manufacturing industry in various countries.

According to the IFR's 2017 World Robot Statistics, 2016 saw 74 robot units per 10,000 employees. The new global robot density average in the manufacturing industries is much higher than the 66 units reported in 2015. 

Republic of Korea has been the number one on the list since 2010, it's density stands at 631 units.

Europe has the highest density, among all regions with 99 units. America has 84 and Asia has 63.

United States has a density of 189 robots, while Canada is not far too behind with 145 robots.

Asia has been leading the pack, in growth percentage with 9% growth in installed robots between 2010 and 2016, marking a shift.

China, the country which prides itself on ultra-cheap labour, saw it;s robot density rise from mere 25 in 2013 to 68 in 2016. It seems to be on it's way to become one of the most automated countries by 2020, plan of it's government.

The top 10 most automated countries in the world are, in descending order, South Korea, Singapore, Germany, Japan, Sweden, Denmark, USA, Italy, Belgium, and Taiwan.
