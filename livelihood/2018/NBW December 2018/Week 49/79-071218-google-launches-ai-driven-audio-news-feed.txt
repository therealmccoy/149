Google is launching a radio-style, on-demand audio news feed available on smart speakers, personalized with the help of artificial intelligence.

It has partnerships with more than a dozen news organizations to deliver an audio feed in the same manner as its smartphone news feed.

"This new experience will bring you an audio news playlist assembled in that moment, for you,It starts with a briefing of top stories and updates on topics you care about, and extends into longer-form content that dives deeper into more stories."

Google Assistant, the AI program developed by the company, will manage the feed, allowing users to skip a story, go back or stop.

The project aims to transform audio news into a Netflix-like experience, available on demand with personalized recommendations.

"For the past century, radio has been a one-size-fits-all medium,Turn on the radio and you're dropped into a show at a moment in time -- regardless of what you already know, where you are, or what you're interested in. Imagine instead if you could have your own radio, one that's available on-demand, accessible throughout your day, and brings you news about the world and your interests."

Smart speakers are no more trojan horses, they are now mainstream content hosepipe, like the television and personal computer. When the technology is commodity, content would be the winner. Google the leader in search has the advantage here with long established partnerships with news organisations across the globe. For other technology players, it would be difficult to beat Google in 'disrupt the radio' game.

Hey Google, How about news interspersed with my favourite songs too? But, please do not insert Google Adwords here.

The audio news feature will roll out first to a limited number of people using the Google Assistant in the United States in English.

Smart speakers are now the new radio, err Smart Radio.
