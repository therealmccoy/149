The Story: Nearly half of Hong Kong youngsters feel “despair” if they do not have anything to post on social media, while a tenth want to break into the ranks of popular online influencers, a first-of-its-kind survey has suggested.

The poll of 2,045 local adolescents, aged between eight and 19, also found that 43% of the young people spent more than three hours a day on social media, with 9% spending at least 10 hours a day.

"Why" this story: 
The age in which we are living is where the identity of a person has not just merged into an offline-online one; but rather reduced to a single one, her/his online identity. A well crafted plot can result into one being an online super-star in almost no time. The values,character,thoughts,action and other such traits have been reduced to old text-books. It is what one show which counts, and what one wants to show which counts. What one cannot be offline, one can be online.

The Perspective:
Huge amount of time at the risk of psychological break-down are being spent online by the youth of today. Looking for that one right moment to "capture hearts" is the one pokemon game we have been playing for almost close to a decade now. All this because the so called "Influencers" are now our new Super-stars. They have become the new idols. 

"What" of this story:
What would it take for you to completely abstain from posting anything on social media? You may visit your account but have to stop the urge to post!
