*Why this story*
Fuel price is something which impacts every single Indian in one way or other, be it Petrol,Diesel or Cooking gas. But how the price of these three most essential commodities are regulated is what we all are in dark. All we get to know whether they are hiked or lowered.

*Perspective*
As a consumer we have a right to know, how the product we buy, is priced. Probably the single largest group of commodities, the fuel prices always grope in dark for Indians. Some countries like Sri Lanka have very aptly made available the very formula according to which the price would be calculated, Indians still are fumbling. Why the government of India, does not come clean on the formula according to which it charges us customer?

*Story*
In Sri Lanka, a committee of very senior government officials have come for a formula according to which they are going to decide the selling price of petrolem fuels in the country. They have even decided how much margin the government is willing to keep on each litre of fuel sold. They also further clearly states why the government wants to keep a profit margin. Clearly a very consumer focused move, right from horse's mouth.

*What of this story?*
Would we as consumers of billions of dollars of fuels collectively, ask from Indian Government the formula for fuel price? We check expiry date on a Rs.5 biscuit pack, but never ask why Petrol is sold at this particular price. Shall we change or let the status quo remain?
