The Story:
India Meteorological Department will now start issuing weather advisories at block level, starting with four states of AP,Telangana,Karnataka and Chhatisgarh. The service which would be starting soon on an experimental basis would then further extend Bihar,Odisha and Maharashtra.

Some 200 blocks out of the four states have been chosen and the experiment is going to cover up to 300 blocks soon. The service is going to help farmers better manage their crop activities like sowing etc.

Currently, district advisories are issued by IMD in collaboration with state agricultural universities and IITs.

"Why" this story:
India is still an agriculture dominant country and though a lot of technology is being used compared to earlier times, at grass-root level, the farmers still grapple with the vagaries of nature. Things are going acute, day by day, with climate changes leading to abrupt floods, heat-waves, thunder-showers, with the farmer getting hit the most.

The Perspective:
Micro level Agro met advisory is one field which still desires a lot to be done, in spite of the fact that the country has progressed tremendously in terms of traditional computing and allied infrastructure. With large districts, having varied topography, the district level advisory issued are often found lacking, just because they get generalised over a vast land mass.
Localised agro-met advisory is going to really help farmers, having a productive yield, the information which would be really for them, and not a generic mass issue advisory.

"What" of this story:
If you are a farmer or know someone in your relation, who has ben using micro agro-met advisory, please share what has been your experience?
