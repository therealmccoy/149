In most offices, every summer and every winter, there's a war going on for control of the office thermostat because people can't agree on how warm or cold their workplace should be. 

In an office, it is difficult to find two people liking the same temperature. What one person is comfortable at, the other is cold.

In fact, employees in some US offices fight so much over the office temperature that some employers install 'dummy' thermostats, where the only thing it offers employees is the illusion of control. 

The actual thermostat is in the closet with the sensor and then they installed dummy thermostats that people can play with. And this is because some people just need to feel like they're changing a thermostat.
