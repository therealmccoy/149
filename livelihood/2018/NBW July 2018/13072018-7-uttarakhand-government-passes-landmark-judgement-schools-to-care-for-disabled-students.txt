The Uttarakhand High Court on Wednesday issued a slew of directions to the state government to ensure that proper facilities are provided in schools to children with special needs.

A division bench of Justices Rajiv Sharma and Lokpal Singh passed the order after taking cognizance of a letter written by one Kamal Gupta four years ago highlighting the difficulties faced by children with special needs in pursuing education.

It directed that all the government, aided and non-aided schools of the state must ensure washrooms, transportation system and barrier-free movement for children with special needs.

“The state government is directed to appoint special educators in all the schools for children with special needs within a period of six months,” the bench said.
