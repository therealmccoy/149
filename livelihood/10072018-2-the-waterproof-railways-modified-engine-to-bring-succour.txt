Central Railway is set to roll out a modified 'waterproof' locomotive engine that can be operated even in 12 inches of water.

Generally, a locomotive engine stops with only four inches of water, forcing the train to stay until the water on the railway tracks recedes. According to a railway official, the modified 'waterproof' locomotive engine can move local trains as well as long-distance trains that get stuck on railway tracks due to water-logging during heavy rainfall.

Over 7 million daily suburban train commuters witness frequent disruption in services in Monsoon.

Many stations including Kurla, Sion, Parel, Matunga and Dadar Delay of trains CR Services shutdown after heavy rainfall that leads to cancellation of trains without intimation Overcrowding at platforms and foot-over bridges Trains get stuck on tracks due to heavy rainfall
