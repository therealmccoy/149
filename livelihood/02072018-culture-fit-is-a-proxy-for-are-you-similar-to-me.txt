Psychologist and management expert Adam Grant says “Almost every company I’ve gone into, what I hear is, ‘Our culture is unique!’” on the latest episode of Recode Decode, hosted by Kara Swisher. “And then I ask, ‘How is it unique?’ and the answers are all the same.”

 When leaders think they are uniquely talented at forging company culture, that belief “closes the door to learning.”

“You end up attracting the same kinds of people because culture fit is a proxy for ‘Are you similar to me? Do i want to hang out with you?’” he said. “So you end up with this nice, homogeneous group of people who fall into groupthink and then it’s easier for them to get disrupted from the outside, and they have trouble innovating and changing.”
