It has been long held by Engineers/Programmers that Managers are not needed. The epic fight between the BS/BE and MBA. 

Engineers believe that, the narrow and constricted thinking of managers, stifle down creativity.

Google also had this problem, in 2008, when it's engineers thought that managers are nothing, but a "necessary evil" .

And then there is only one way Google could have found the answer, data.

Being an engineer driven company, the hypothesis itself was biased from the start, "Managers don't matter".

And they couldn’t have been more wrong. Google research found that not only are managers a critical component to corporate structure—but that good managers increased job satisfaction, retention and employment within their groups and the organization as a whole. 

That realization opened an entirely new pathway for research at Google: how do you identify what makes someone a “good” manager, and more importantly, how do you make someone “better"?

Here are the set of eight attributes, to be a good manager, a hypothesis derived through data. It has been further quantified through an active feedback loop of employees.

1.Be a good coach.

2. Empower the team and do not micromanage.

3. Express interest/concern for team member's success and well-being.

4.Be productive and result oriented.

5.Be a good communicator.

6. Help with career development.

7. Have a vision.

8. Use your technical skills to advise.

The attributes listed above are effusing common-sense, and can be applied to any field or industry.
