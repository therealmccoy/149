"Unlimited coffee and snacks" is what most of the today's startups "Perks" sections starts of any job posting. There are many who still could not make to the mark yet, and dream of getting to that 'status'.

A simple economics 101 question to answer. Two employees are being paid same salary, one of them has a bigger appetite and eats more of free food supplied by company, isn't it she/he is getting paid more? 

So, if an employee who is health conscious, who in turn is more effective for the organisation, in both near and long term is being penalised?

Free snacks/food is damaging for a company. A healthy employee gets penalised and many employees, get unhealthier, adding to not only unproductive woes but also future health-care related costs.

So does the doling out free snacks as perks make sense?

There is a certain amount of welfare expense which the company does by providing snacks/food to employees. If it has to be distributable to all employees, which it should, then instead of doling out food, the employees should be provided with food vouchers/coupons, which can then be redeemed with cash.

A Sodexo food voucher is an apt example of this. Every employee gets the same share of company's spend, employees can then either spend it or redeem in the form of cash. A win-win for both employees and employer.

"Stop providing free junk food. It's not even really "free" when you consider that the company could instead just pay workers better. Free food, after all, is a form of in-kind compensation. It costs the company money. And by spending this money on junk food, companies aren't only denying us the freedom to choose how to spend it, they're also encouraging us to make bad health decisions."
