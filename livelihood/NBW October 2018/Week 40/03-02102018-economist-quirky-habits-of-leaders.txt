There are seminars and gazillion books written on motivational self-helps. There are publications which survive just on the inferiority complex/ Impostor's Syndrome / Anxiety of people, posting click-baits article, about how to be the next trillion-dollar-founder-CEO.

While no doubt, one needs to stand on "the shoulder of giants" in order to see, what you want to see; but that does not mean that it is done in it's entirety, without losing the meaning or context of it.

After all, everything in this world is relative.

We are a planet of six billion and counting, so what are the probabilities that the advice of a top leader/CEO would work for a vast majority of people?

It's better not to guess, at all.

Also, one get to see the quirky/maverick side of only the poster-boys, who made it. The examples always follow the success.

If your neighbour who works as a clerk in a government office, tells you that he wakes up every morning at 3.45 am; one is not going to follow him, but if Tim Cook tells you, that he wakes up at 3.45 am; everyone tries to follow at once. 

Why?

Because we have been always taught to miss the woods for trees. If Tim Cook is doing this, then obviously it can work for me too.

Like, seriously?

And then another leader/CEO and so on and so forth and all it results in to mental/nervous breakdown; only increasing the anxiety/Impostor Syndrome and not lessening it.

Follow the advice/examples of great leaders/heroes/founders but only after giving it a clear perspective, with respect to your individual life.

Only follow those advices and examples which feel like second skin to you, not the ones which are like a mask, worn with utter discomfort and for short period.

Follow your instinct and gut and measure the advice offered, and yes keep a heap of salt nearby.
