The void in people's life have been extending at such a pace that we need to find new sources, to fill that up.

First came the social media, then the dating apps and when they were not enough, we have now videos.

As data becomes cheaper than water (in this country), opportunists want to make merry of moment.

Cable TV, YouTube channels and forwarded videos of Whatsapp were not enough it seems.

Enter, the streaming companies.

Some clever marketing, coupled with the peer pressure of "Tuney dekha kya?" meant that, people were soon going to fall in the new "sink hole of time".

Falling in yet another such hole, when there are only 24 hours to spend in a day.

Cheap (almost free) data, monthly unlimited subscription from streaming companies is a potent addictive combination.

An Indian, who would spend on an average of 7 hours daily, streaming shows on Netflix, has officially become the first addict.

    Dr. Manoj Kumar Sharma, the head of the SHUT clinic said that binge-watching helped the patient forget his worries while he was unemployed for a long period of time:

    Whenever his family pressurized him to earn a living, or when he saw his friends doing well, he would watch the shows on offer continuously. It was a method of escapism. He could forget about his problems, and he derived immense pleasure from it.


The obvious thing is that, if we have a fulfilling and enriched life, we do not need "time sink holes". Instead of treating the disease, we always try to treat the symptoms.

People who venture too much into online realms, do not have a real life.
