Snapchat is releasing a series of reports which outlines their user's behaviour, both online and offline.

The reports, are being called "Retail Footprints". They look at how Snapchat users shop at big-box, apparel and luxury stores. This is company’s latest effort to become synonymous with shopping.

The data shows Snapchat has an in-depth knowledge about their user's shopping behaviour.  This includes what are their interests, when they shop and what they do before and after shopping.

While 13- to 17-year-old visit big-box stores the most, 18- to 24-year-old dominate in frequenting apparel stores. Like big-box shoppers, apparel-store users are going to deli or groceries before shopping and visiting banks or hair salons after. These shoppers are 2.5 times more likely to visit theme parks, 2.8 times “to be coffee lovers,” and 2.6 times more likely to attend art and cultural events.

Interesting point from the study of those who shop at luxury stores like LV or Ralph Lauren, they are seven percent more likely to go for shopping at the end of month. Of course, there is no month-end woes for the rich, but also it could be that, stores might be offering discounts at the end of month? After all, every one loves discount, rich or poor.

These reports have been released to woe back the advertisers, when there is nothing stopping the Instagram juggernaut. Snapchat has still 100 million MAU, who spend about 30 minutes every day, on the app.
