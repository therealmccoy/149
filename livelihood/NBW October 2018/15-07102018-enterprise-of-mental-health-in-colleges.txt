In the good old days, college was supposed to be all fun . At least most of the fun part, and some serious part on account of studies.

For today's generation, it has become a dreaded word. 
Gaining entry in a decent enough college is becoming tougher and tougher. Surviving the college years in this intense scrutiny, judgement age is toughest. Where is the fun, most will like to ask.

Most college students are now suffering from some type of psychological disorder. Depression is the most common one.

Common sense says that no amount of focus on learning would help, unless student is in sound mental state.

Talk about, first principles. And so far, hardly anyone focussed on the first principles of learning.

Educational institutions are now focusing on mental health awareness and well being.

So far, the Edtech space has also focussed only on the learning and development part of education. But now, people have started realising gravity of mental health problem in education.

https://youatcollege.com/ is one such platform in US, which helps students in realising the mental health issues, and seek guidance at campus.

You at College started at Colorado State University and now already  used by 20, and some more joining.

Each platform is tailored so that students see information relevant to  their own campus. The cost to institutions ranges from $0.75 to $3.00  per student per year, depending on campus enrolment and the level of  customization they require.

In India, large Edtech companies, SaaS or otherwise focus on learning and development. But there is very big space available to provide mental well-being and help to students.

Schools and colleges are going to pay for such kind of service, because students matter to them most.  And what is a student worth, if they are not in sound mental health to learn.

Edtech requires to go back to first principles of learning!
