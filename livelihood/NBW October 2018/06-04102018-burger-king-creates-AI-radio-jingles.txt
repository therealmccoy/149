There is a game which has been playing in the town for quite some time, it is called "Find for X", where "X" is any industry from "A to Z" and one has to "find" , how AI fits or contributes to it.

The game has been a lot interesting so far, but who thought one day, "A" would stand for "Advertising".

Like, seriously?

Because, in advertising, "emotions" always ruled over "intelligence". And we never said, "Artificial Emotions", though this is what is actually found nowadays.

Enter, Burger King, yes the famous, US based restaurant chain, with over 15,000 locations worldwide.

Burger King has successfully created radio jingles, created by AI.

"The scripts for the commercials were generated by a "artificial neural network with advanced pattern recognition capabilities by analysing thousands of fast-food commercials and competitive reports from industry research."

And of course, it is being touted as "first ads entirely created by an A.I. to air on national television".

In an industry, where, keeping track of "Sense and Sensibility" of every part of human race is paramount and comes first, AI obliterates all the drudgery of it.

Why?

Simply, because it has not been created by humans. What has not been created (directly) by humans, makes it very difficult to be judged by humans also, after all, whom are you going to blame?

Also, one single jingle can be deployed in may be every part of the world, English might not be the universal language of the world, but everywhere on this planet, people have been used to listening to robots, after all.

Needless to say, it is something novel and cool, and obviously people are going to pay attention to it.

Let's utter the dreaded "D" word, is it the "times up" for advertising industry also?

Nah!

Our lives could be robotic, but we do not want to dread it further by listening to a robotic voice. After all, something should be left "unartificial" also.
