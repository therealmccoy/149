Union IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said he hopes that WhatsApp considers sensitivities of the Indian people, given that India is its largest market.

The government too is planning to introduce some measures to control fake information. These will later be shared with social media platforms.

Speaking about these measures, government sources said that one of them is to suggest WhatsApp to revoke access to the messaging platform from desktops.

"WhatsApp should be made accessible only on mobile phones. Besides this, the account opening details should be either from the same IP address or at least from the same email id," the official said.

There is also a suggestion that WhatsApp should start flagging content that is being generated from a stolen mobile phone.
