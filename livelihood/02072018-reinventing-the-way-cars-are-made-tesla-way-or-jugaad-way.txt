Just outside the north wing of Tesla’s sprawling electric-car plant here, an unusual structure has taken shape in the last few weeks: a tent, about 50 feet high and several hundred feet long, its taut gray canvas membrane supported by aluminum columns.

 The semi-permanent structure houses a third assembly line — part of a desperate effort to speed up production of the Model 3, the car that Elon Musk, has said is critical to the company’s financial health and immediate future.

Tesla has also raced to iron out kinks in the assembly process, mainly by scrapping some complicated robotic machines that proved ill suited to certain tasks, and hiring hundreds of workers to replace them.

Can the jugaad way work on large scale industrial manufacturing also, or it is only elon Musk?
