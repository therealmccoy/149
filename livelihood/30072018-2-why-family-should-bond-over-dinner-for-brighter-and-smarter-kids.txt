The Story;
In New Zealand, Auckland University professors, Dr Jennifer Utter and Dr Simon Denny have been studying the links between family meals and the well-being of adolescents. The Youth 2000 National Youth Health and Wellbeing Surveys cover 25,000 secondary school students in the country.

"Their research shows that adolescents who share frequent family meals report better relationships with their families, better eating behaviours and better indicators of emotional well being. "These benefits may also extend to parents, as we have recently found that parents who frequently share meals with their families eat more fruits and vegetables and report better family functioning."

"Why" this story:
In a country where the family's possession of material wealth is more pride upon than the health of relationship among the constituents, India is slowly inching towards being a zombie state. The rise in dual income families where the kids are being left on the mercy of mushrooming day-care facilities, and parents working long days, returning home too tired to ask more than a couple of questions, the innocent little ones are left fumbling for answers on their own.

The Perspective:
The dinner is one meal where all the family members can come together and bond over shared food. Since time immemorial, all religions have advocated the godliness of a meal shared, yet in today's rushed to the bones lifestyle, over blind chase of material success, the long held tradition is withering.
Not withstanding, the onslaught of screens the small one, the medium one and the large one; the dinner is one activity, which has been totally hijacked by them.

"What" of this story?
How many times are you able to sit down with your family to have dinner (without the screen hijack) and what would you do to do more so?
