It all comes down to 3 simple questions. Answer ‘YES’ to all of these questions, and you’ve got yourself a keeper in Obama’s eyes. "Life is long," the ex-president of United States said. "These are the things that really matter over the long term."

1. Are They Interesting?

"Is she someone you find interesting?" said Obama according to Pfeiffer. “You will spend more time with this person than anyone else for the rest of your life, and there is nothing more important than always wanting to hear what she has to say about things."

2. Are They Funny?

"Does she make you laugh?" said POTUS.

3. Will They Be A Good Parent?

"I don't know if you want kids, but if you do, do you think she will be a good mum?" Obama said for seemingly obvious, but often overlooked aspect to marriage.
