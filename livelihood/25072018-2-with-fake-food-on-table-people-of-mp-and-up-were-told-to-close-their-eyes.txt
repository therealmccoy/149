The Story:
An Italian photographer, Alessio Mamo asked few very poor Indians from the states of MP and UP to close their eyes, in front of a table packed with fake food and then dream about their "dream food". The photographer who took these photographs in 2011, described his project as "conceptual project about hunger issues in India". The photographs have gone viral after being put on the instagram account of World Press Photo foundation. There is no further information provided by the photographer on what was the conclusion of the project, let alone impact.

"Why" this story:
India has always been a magnet since ancient times for the mystic allure it presents to those who live in so called countries which are most of the times smaller than smaller of our states. The liberty of "white skin" and the associated privilege which comes with it in the land where, what you are is still determined by the colour of your skin (and now may be your instagram selfies), lets people to do all kinds of bizzare things and get away with it.

The Perspective:
India is still ranked 110 on the list of 119 developing countries on global hunger index. Whatever our politicians might be claiming, the truth is that for the lure of few hundred rupees (which keeps food on their table for next few nights), still our poor brothers are willing to be part of anything, for those coming from (2X2) countries. Those who try to find employment elsewhere in the country, in an rightful manner are lynched, like in Maharashtra.

"What" of this story:
What can we do to stop this hunger porn? Perhaps we start from the basic of compassion towards anyone who has to leave her/his home in desperation to quench hunger.
