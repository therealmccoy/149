*Upfront*: A photo-taking-impairment effect has been observed such that participants are less likely to remember objects they photograph than objects they only observe.

*Study's Premise*: According to the offloading hypothesis, taking photos allows people to offload organic memory onto the camera's prosthetic memory, which they can rely upon to “remember” for them.

*Gospel*: Taking a photo can cause something to be less well remembered than if it is simply observed. This photo-taking-impairment effect has been explained by a cognitive offloading account such that when people take photos they come to rely on the camera to “remember” what was photographed for them, not bothering to remember it for themselves. 

*Your next step?*:  Would you decrease snapping and increase observing?
