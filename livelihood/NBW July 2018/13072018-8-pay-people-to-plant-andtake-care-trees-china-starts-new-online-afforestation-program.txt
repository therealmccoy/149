Chinese policymakers are hoping to kill two birds with one stone through a tree-planting program that endeavors to trap carbon emissions and combat poverty.

Announced Sunday at the 10th Eco Forum Global in provincial capital Guiyang, the voluntary program connects residents of Guizhou province’s low-income villages with individuals and businesses across the country who are willing to pay to offset their own carbon footprint. Villagers plant the trees and pocket the money — expected to reach more than 1,000 yuan ($150) a year per household, in a province where the average annual income for rural residents is only 8,869 yuan.

Fu Yeqiu, head of the climate change department under Guizhou’s provincial development and reform commission, explained that she and her colleagues will help villagers record the trees they plant, calculate their carbon sequestration, and upload the information to an online platform. When people buy offsets on the platform, the money is deposited directly into the planter’s bank account. Each tree earns the planter 3 yuan per year for both the initial planting and subsequent care.
