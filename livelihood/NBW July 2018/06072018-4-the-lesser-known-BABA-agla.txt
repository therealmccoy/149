Alibaba Global Leadership Academy, is a one-year leadership training program for MBA graduates with at least three years’ of work experience.

The selected candidates rotate between roles in Alibaba divisions, including classroom teaching on Alibaba’s culture, and field trips ranging from logistics hubs to see how deliveries are managed, to exploring China’s original Silk Road trading route on a trek through the Gobi desert. 

Competition for AGLA places is tough. More than 3,000 people applied for 30 places on the first programme, which started in 2016. In 2017,applications doubled for the same number of places. 

The first cohort of AGLA participants finished their 12 months in October 2017 and have been sent on assignments all over the world. The group included Alibaba staff from 14 countries.
