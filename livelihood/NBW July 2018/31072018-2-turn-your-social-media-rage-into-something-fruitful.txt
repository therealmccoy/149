The Story:
Treespond is an online campaign that allows the users to sponsor planting of a tree in response to any irresponsible comments by Trump related to climate change. Essentially, the frustration channelises positively into something fruitful, literally. Each tree costs about Rs.700 and comes with a certificate, with the tree's ID number and it's geographical location. Treespond has a variety of Trump quotes related to climate listed, and they have a limited count of trees listed against them, which people can sponsor.

"Why" this story:
Trump has been using Twitter as it's mouth-piece. Perhaps for the first time in US presidential history, most important foreign and domestic policy statements are tweeted first, and then a government release is issued, if it is so. This phenomena hence is not limited to only US and more and more politicians including those in India, are making Twitter their personal mouth-piece. People who get enraged, they come on Twitter also, to vent out their anger and frustration.

The Perspective:
Social Media platforms if used wisely can be a great cathartic tool, but this has been taken to extremes, when in response to some disturbing tweet, in return, hundreds of thousands people start venting out their anger and helplessness, as if their tweets collectively is going to change the status quo. It is possible in some democratic countries, but slowly the effect is wading out and governments are beginning to take the online rage as ephemeral. In such times, when the shelf life of a tweet is no more than few hours at max, campaigns like Treespond can be a hard-to-miss staunch response for a much bigger span of time, in respond to a disturbing tweet. 

"What" of this story:
What do you think could be alternates to planting trees in response to tweets of some irresponsible politicians?
