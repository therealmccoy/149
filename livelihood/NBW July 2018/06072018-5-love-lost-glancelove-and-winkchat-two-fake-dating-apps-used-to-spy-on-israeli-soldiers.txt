The Israeli military experienced cyberattacks first-hand as Hamas-operated dating and sports apps reportedly tried to lure the soldiers into giving up sensitive security information.

Following reports of suspicious young ladies flirting with Israeli Defence Forces personnel, the military launched an operation codenamed Broken Heart and found out that the sham apps were available on the Google Play store. They have already been downloaded by 100 soldiers.

The first two bogus apps were called Glancelove and Winkchat. The third one, Golden Cup, was promoted as a live score aid which was filled with information about the ongoing World Cup Russia.

Once downloaded, the apps would allow Hamas militants to see the owner's location and contact list, and to turn the cellphone into a recording device.
