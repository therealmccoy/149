Earlier this week, the clothing company ASOS released a fully waterproof jumpsuit that its website noted has been adapted to be “wheelchair-friendly.”

Reporter and Paralympic hopeful Chloe Ball-Hopkins collaborated with ASOS on the design, which features a hem that’s longer in the back to help prevent the pants from riding up, and adjustable cuffs for setting sleeve length.

In an interview with the BBC News show Victoria Derbyshire, Ball-Hopkins, who uses a wheelchair, explained that the idea came to her after she struggled to find something appropriate to wear to a music festival when the weather took a turn for the worse. She sent an email to ASOS detailing the problem, and the company agreed to work with her.

A step towards making society more inclusive.
