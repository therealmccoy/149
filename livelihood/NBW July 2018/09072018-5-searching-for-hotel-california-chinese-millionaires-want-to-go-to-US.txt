The U.S. is the top destination among Chinese millionaires looking to move their families, and money, to another country, according to a new study.

More than a third of rich Chinese surveyed “are currently considering” emigrating to another country, according to a report from the Hurun Research Institute, a China-based wealth research firm, and Visas Consulting Group, an immigration advisory firm. They surveyed 224 Chinese people with an average wealth of $4.5 million.

The American education system remains one of the main reasons Chinese investors most favor the United States. In addition, it came out tops in terms of visa-free travel and ease of adaptability. President Trump’s tax cuts also saw it score higher in the tax category this year.

Los Angeles was the top city for Chinese millionaires to buy property, followed by New York, Boston and San Francisco.
