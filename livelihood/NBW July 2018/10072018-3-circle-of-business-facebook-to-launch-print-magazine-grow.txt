Facebook, the world’s biggest social network, quietly launched in June a high-end print magazine called Grow.
Labeled as a “quarterly magazine for business leaders”, the publication seemed to be targeted at senior-level company executives. A vice president of Facebook was in charge of it.

Grow will be mailed to business leaders worldwide for free, and will be available at clubs, five-star hotels, airport lounges, etc. The content will cover business, technology, fashion and other topics.

The magazine appears aimed at the same kind of audience that patronizes business magazines such as Fortune, Forbes, and Bloomberg Businessweek.

Grow’s content will appear on its Facebook and Instagram page, so it’s sort of a multi-media brand. Most magazines would launch a print edition first and then expand online. But Grow marks an opposite approach, as an online giant is making a foray into print media.
