Fitness competitor Ashley Horner is no stranger to pushing her body to the limits: in the 15-months, she's completed a 1,350 mile bike ride, climbed Mt. Rainer, and run 230 miles in 72 hours — all for charity. 

In her latest challenge, Horner is planning to complete 50 Ironman triathlons in 50 days. The fitness competitor, who has her own training program, will start the challenge in Haiti on Aug. 8, complete full-Ironman triathlons in 48 states, and end in Haiti, where she is donating proceeds from the 50-day triathlon blitz to the Maison Fortuné Orphanage. She hopes to raise $100,000 for the orphanage. 

“I just didn’t feel like it would be complete if I started it in Haiti, and didn’t end there, I want to end it there because that’s where my heart is and the purpose behind what I’m doing," she said. "I know when the going gets tough ... and the suffering kicks in I will know my end goal is to be back there with the children."
