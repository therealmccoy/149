Following his "AI Transformation Playbook", Andrew Ng further elucidates the points discussed in the playbook, starting with the very important first step, "How to choose your first AI Project"?

The decision maker has been provided with a handy check-list, through which she could dipstick, the best proposal for a pilot AI project, from the several she would be receiving, across the department.

The most important yardstick is that the project should not have a very long gestation period. It should provide a "quick win".

Also, the project should add "value" to the organisation, and should not be a filler. Something which could be done relatively quickly and whose value could be measured is the ideal AI project to start.

A great project would have the above two criteria, and it would be a simple one like just automating a couple of daily routine tasks of the organisation.

A leader who is accountable for the project should be appointed, with a dedicated team. Effective communication between the team members is critical, for such pioneering adventures and hence they should be chosen more for their 'attitude', rather than 'aptitude'.

So, select the right pilot project and focus on flawless execution to step in to the AI revolution.
