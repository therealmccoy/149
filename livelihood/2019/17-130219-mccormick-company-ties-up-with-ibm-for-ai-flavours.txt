Soon, one can have instant or ready foods flavours prepared with the help of AI.

McCormick & Company,which is a global leader in flavour has partnered with IBM to bring in innovation in flavours and change the course of the industry. 

Product developers from the company across the globe, would thus be able to explore new flavour and combine them in exciting ways, after analysing hundreds of millions of data-points, across the consumer preference spectrum, thanks to the AI system.

IBM has combined it's machine learning with McCormick's 40+ years of proprietary sensory science and taste data, which includes decades of past product formulas and millions of data points related to consumer taste preferences and palettes, to bring together a proprietary AI system, which inarguably would be unmatched.

With $5.4 billion in annual sales, the McCormick company manufactures, markets and distributes spices, seasoning mixes, condiments and other flavourful products to the entire food industry â€“ retail outlets, food manufacturers and food-service businesses. 

Company's first AI enabled product platform, called "ONE" (such an apt name) is expected to be available by mid of this year.
