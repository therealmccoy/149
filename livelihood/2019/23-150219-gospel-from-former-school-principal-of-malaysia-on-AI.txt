China has made strides in AI thanks to the drive and leadership shown by it's academic institutions. The effect has now percolated down to even schools. And AI research has not been an unique or isolated instance of Chinese education system showing prowess, education is religion over there and often matter of life and death and teachers in China are respected to take their job with all respect and seriousness.

As every nation starts talking AI and rush to implement it, in order to be seen as 'progressive' and '21st Century' ready; there has been more 'talk of the talk', rather than 'talk of the walk'.

A retired school principal of Malaysia snubbed the Education Minister by saying in front of 200 people at an education forum that, "why the government was focusing on artificial intelligence, when there is no intelligence in the country". He was referring to the low quality of teachers and 'rock bottom' education system in Malaysia.

Mr.V Chakaravathy has hence pointed the most important factor for implementing AI strategy for any nation, including India (country's educational system still sleeps in silos), that before trying to implement AI, left right and centre, create a strong foundation in terms of educational institutions and capable teachers, who can take the AI bandwagon further by creating capable scientists and researchers.
