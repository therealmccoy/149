Amid concerns of job loss over AI and in order to address the same in a comprehensive manner, Apple CEO Tim Cook and IBM CEO Ginni Rometty were appointed to Trump's American Workforce Policy Advisory Board yesterday.

The board would formalise a strategy to revamp the American workforce for 21st century. As the level of automation and use of AI/ML technology increases, giving rise to high-tech jobs and diminishing the low skills one, the board would try to keep the balance intact through skills upgradation. 

In another terms, the board is tasked with getting the 'low' skilled jobs, 'high'.

Incidentally, daughter of Mr.President, Ivanka Trump would co-chair the board. After all 'Jobs' is in the family.
