The problem with machines is that they are built for the sole purpose of obeying commands, and so does the Machine Learning algorithms are. Once a command is issued (sans any error), machine would execute it, without any further ado (sans any logic).

Surprisingly, machines made out of logic, are sans any logic. And this is proving to be quite a catastrophe.

Machine Learning algorithms are trained to find patterns, and they do their job pretty well, even when there is no logical pattern.

When there is a singular dataset, running a ML algorithm over it would find a 'pattern' and there is no way it could be countered, unless any other comparative dataset is available for processing. And thus reproducing the results or patterns is becoming impossible.

Science has been able to progress thus far only because, experiments could be done by many and argued with counters.

ML algorithms are throwing a pattern smack in the face of scientific researchers saying, 'take it or leave it'. There is no way to critique them.
