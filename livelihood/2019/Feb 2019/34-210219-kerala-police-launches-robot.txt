Kerala police has deployed the first humanoid police robot in the country at it's headquarters. CM Mr.P Vijayan himself inaugrated the robot.
Kerala Police partnered with Asimov Robotics, a Kochi based robotic startup for development and launch of KP-Bot.
Currently, it would be used at the Kerala Police HQs to meet and greet visitors, gather required information from them and to provide them solicited information in a detailed manner.
The bot would also meet and greet officers through face recognition.
While the bot is not supposed to replace any human jobs, it shall certainly help in reducing the workload of already over-worked police force.
