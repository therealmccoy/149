Indians are now increasingly using e-commerce platforms to make the purchase of FMCG products, and it was evident when Amazon's "Pantry" offline for a short period at the beginning of the month, leading to outage from many loyal customers.
The products are routinely available at nearby 'Kirana' but the lack of 'arm chair comfort' in completing the transaction lead to people venting their displeasure on social media platforms.

Seeing that times are changing, ITC the FMCG major has decided to start it's own e-commerce operation in a limited scope.

It's online store would be limited in operation, only to metros and would store only it's premium line. This would also ensure that customers have a dedicated resource online, which has all the premium products of ITC available, all the time.

Going by the incredible story of ITC revamping itself from Cigarettes major to Cookie major; there could be much more cooking over there, but under wraps in butter-paper.
