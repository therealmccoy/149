China is at war with rest of the world over Huawei and it's 5G technology. But for the threat to work, it requires trumpet too.
Show the world, what could be done with the technology, and it shall convince many, to adopt it.

Already in construction is world's first '5G Smart Highway' at Wuhan in Hubei province of central China. Being developed in concert with China Mobile,it would have “smart toll stations” which would be san any human operators. Real-time traffic information would be available and it shall assist in making AI powered predictions. The highway would also be autonomous cars ready.

Incidentally, Wuhan is the happiest city in the country also. Certainly, the smart highway would make it happier!

China Mobile would install more than 2000 5G base stations for the project and even plans to test the autonomous cars on it's own, as it has applied for autonomous driving permit.

This is while 4G still remains a dream in India, Jio or without Jio!
