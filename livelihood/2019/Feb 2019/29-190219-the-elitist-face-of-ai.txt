Future would be driven by AI and there would not be any sphere of life which would be left untouched by it. When everyone would use AI, everyone should 'know' about AI. 
Just like calculus, not everyone uses it in daily life, but being surrounded by physics of calculus everywhere, it helps certainly to understand the grand scheme of things, if one knows calculus.

But it seems, AI is having a calculus effect on young minds. Majority of them believe, that they are not 'smart' enough for pursuing AI. Only one in four student in the age group of 8-18 is interested in pursuing a career in AI.

The impostor syndrome which used to rule the kids mind in case of mathematics is now showing it's ugly face in terms of AI.

The major fallacy which is helping in this, is the fact that only those who are good in code and programming can work in AI related fields. While the fact is that, AI would throw open so many jobs, which are not dependent upon programming literacy. Like, re-skiling.

This calls for broadening everyone's horizon about the job opportunities to be open with AI revolution, sans any coding skill requirements.
