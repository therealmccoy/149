India's premier data institution, Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata, has finally risen to the challenge of artificial intelligence. The institution now plans to set up a 4 acre 'Centre for excellence on Artificial Intelligence' at Bengal Silicon Valley, in New Town.

The centre aims to be both training and research facility, giving both students and researchers to try their hand on emerging data related technologies, including AI.

While Chinese academic institutions have been leading the AI research and development in China, and has been able to provide trained researchers to industry, most of them unicorn startups; Indian academic institutions are mostly at 'proposal' stage.
