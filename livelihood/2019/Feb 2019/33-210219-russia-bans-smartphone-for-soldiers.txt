Russian parliament has brought in a law with an overwhelming majority vote, which bans soldiers on using smartphones while on duty. 
The bill disallows soldiers from using any phone which can access internet, take pictures or record videos, effectively any smartphone.
Needless to say, the move is to protect the sensitive information involving troops and their deployment from both domestic and foreign threats.
In a sign of times to come, this could be a pre-emptive move, with the rise in use of AI/ML in smartphones and apps.
While no phone is secure, a feature-phone is the most secure phone, by any means.
