Swiggy raising hundreds of millions of dollars has clearly it's ambition cut-out, way beyond just food delivery.
It has announced today the launch of Swiggy Stores, which would have items of everyday use, from hundreds of local stores. So from food delivery to anything delivered, is a swift move by Swiggy.

The store is in beta and starts from Gurgaon, where it has already tied up with 200 big box retailers and eventually wants to have more than 3500 under it's fold.

With a dedicated fleet for delivery, it was just a matter of time that Swiggy would ahve entered a comparable space, such as grocery delivery, taking on the likes of Grofers, who has also raised hundreds of millions of dollars.

Currently, right from grocery, foods and vegetables to even flowers are available for the residents of Gurgaon.
