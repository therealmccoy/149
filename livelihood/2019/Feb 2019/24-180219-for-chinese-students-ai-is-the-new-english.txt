Chinese parents are now sending their elementary and middle school aged kids to AI Camps, where corporate trainers train them in AI and associated technologies. In fact, many language training centres have started courses offering related to AI, just like English or Japanese. 
And well, it's no surprise that these training camps are getting completely sold out, even though they cost as much as Rs.10,000 per day. For Chinese parents, after English, AI is the surest path to prosperity, where an AI educated person can earn more than thrice of the average salary.

Government is helping this 'education wildfire' spread as this spring hundreds of elementary and junior high students get introduced to AI in their schools.
Companies like Tencent also held AI related coaching camps, to generate interest among kids. Going by the standard and respect which Chinese people have for education, and the cut-throat competition,'AI Education' is sure going to produce some unicorns
