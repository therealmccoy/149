Elon Musk is an inspiration for everyone, but very few take the inspiration to real conclusion.

Waqar Ali from Meerut, an automotive engineering student from Delhi Institute of Engineering and Technology has made an electric bike which can travel 100 Kms on single charge and attains a top-speed of 150 kmph.

The prototype bike has been made by scavenging parts from other motorcycles, like forks and allowy eheels of KTM and fuel tank and chasis from Bajaj Pulsar NS200 and all in all, the bike has costed a mere Rs.72,000 from scratch.

The bike has a regenerator motor and could be charged with a laptop charger as well, and above all like a car, it has a reverse gear as well.

While prototype to production is a long and arduous path, but certainly, when it comes to innovation in electric vehicles, India is going to have few of it's own 'Musks'.
