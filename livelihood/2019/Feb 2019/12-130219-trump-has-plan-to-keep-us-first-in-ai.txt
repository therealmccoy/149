President Donald Trump signed an executive order yesterday, that sets the motion to make 'America great again AI'.

"American AI Initiative" , as the document is called, outlines the grand AI strategy of American government.

The order says that direct funding agencies of US government would allocate funds for AI projects on priority.

Federal data, computing resources would be made available to AI researchers. One of the most important part of the order is that it directs the US National Institute of Standards and Technology to work on AI standards. Government would also re-train it's employees to be ready for the coming AI wagon.

Trump also called for international co-operation and partnership on artificial intelligence with other nations, but surely he did not meant China by that.
