Kerala Motor Vehicle Department is now equipping it's speed detecting cameras with AI. The cameras would not be able to detect helmet-less drivers and those not wearing seat-belts.
Some of these cameras are already in operation at Walayar, Wadakkanchery and Kozhikode.
CDAC or  Centre for Development of Advanced Computing is implementing this project and in the trial runs, the accuracy of the software has been found to be true in 98% of the cases.
The challan would be automatically sent to the driver's address, once the driver is found to be erring. Thus it would reduce the manual intervention by officers.
