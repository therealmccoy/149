There are novel and noble ways to protest, unheard in the times when rowdiness rules the road.
Farmers from the constituencies of Bodhan, Balkonda, Nizamabad Rural, Nizamabad Urban, Korutla, Armoor and Jagtial, which fall under the Parliamentary constituency of Nizamabad, have filed at least 250 nominations for upcoming Lok Sabha elections.

The farmers have been long fighting for establishment of National Turmeric Board and MSP for Turmeric. Repeated assurances by politicians did nothing to avail. So they decided to take the matters in their own hand.
“We were left with no other option. They (government) have curtailed all our freedom; we are not allowed to conduct rallies or protest on roads. Hence, we took up this decision to register our protest.We wanted to file at least 1,000 nominations, but due to intimidation by the ruling party leaders, we couldn’t file so many nominations.”

3. The return of the king of influence - The Newsletter
https://hbr.org/2015/10/the-triumphant-return-of-the-email-newsletter

“No one cares about traffic anymore. Everything is so divided up — you’ve got your blog, then Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest.”

The best part about newsletters have been that they are easy to consume, with few and focussed items each morning, providing links where interested readers can take a deeper dive. And they’re regular, arriving always on a certain day, at a certain time.

In the times when plethora of content,is available all across the screens, 24x7, newsletter is still personal and intimate. Instead of surfing on screens endlessly, one can just 'arrive' in a matter of few minutes about what it most important for them that day.

4. The world's first social network and it is not anti-social !
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/technology/new-social-network-email-newsletter.html

It has been termed as “the world’s oldest networked publishing platform.” 
The newsletter still persists for a variety of reasons, and the greatest among them is they do not pester, even while ensuring the networking.
There is no incessant rolling of notifications, trolling and stuff which is not necessary, least to say. Both for the reader as well as the creator, it does away with the addiction of constant consuming and sharing.

“With newsletters, we can rebuild all of the direct connections to people we lost when the social web came along.”

5. Newsletter : Where algorithms don't come between the publisher and the reader
https://boingboing.net/2019/03/20/why-newsletters-are-the-best-f.html

Once a reader has signed up for a newsletter, that act of faith, becomes a direct and personal relationship between the publisher and the reader, which then is devoid of any external influences.

In today's world where the audience reach varies every Friday and is on the mercy of algorithm changes being made by social media majors, the newsletter provides a consistent reach. 
Confirming to the rules of social media majors for publishers, whenever they make an algorithmic change for the profit of their corporations, is a kin to being in a hostage situation, perpetually. The freedom of creation thus vanishes.

6. The business models of newsletters
https://medium.com/@kylelibra/the-business-models-behind-popular-email-newsletters-1f6b8ce76b5b

The business/revenue models of newsletters can be grouped in to four:

1. Freemium + Original Content
Newsletters from the traditional news publishers come in to this category. The sole purpose of such publishers is content marketing.

2. Freemium + Curated Content
From individuals to corporations, fall into this category. While there are some who publish their own analyses and perspectives, some use this form to drive traffic to their parent site. Most of such newsletters consist of re-written version of someone else's work.

3. Paid + Curated Content
The toughest one to crack, yet with the combination of algorithms and human intelligence, a really good set of curated work can warrant paid subscribers.

4. Paid + Original Content
Some of the best 'one person' business has been created in this category and even a small set of ardent fans (paying) can ensure a consistent (and commendable) revenue for the publisher.

7. The important benchmarks to gauge the performance of your newsletter
https://mailchimp.com/resources/email-marketing-benchmarks/

While there are other metrics, to begin with the two most important metrics one hsould track everyday is the Open Rate and Click Rate in order to measure the efficacy of newsletters.

a) Open Rates are one of the best ways to gauge whether your email strategy is working. This number shows what percentage of your audience opens the emails you send them. A great open rate, it usually means your subject lines resonate with your audience. The average open rate is 21%

b) The click rate is a percentage that tells how many successfully delivered emails got at least 1 click. This number shows whether or not audience finds emails relevant enough to click through for more. The average click-rate is 2.43%

Further to it are, Bounce Rates and Unsubscribe Rate.

8. 'Less is more' and other secret recipes for a thriving newsletter business
https://www.inc.com/5-secrets-of-a-great-e-newsletter-business.html

a) K.I.S.S
The newsletter is meant to de-clutter, so it should not be cluttered. Less is more with newsletters. For a long and fruitful one-to-one relationship, the reader should not be deluged with either too many articles or ads.

b) LTV should be 5x of the reader's acquisition
The Life Time Value of the reader (by the way of ads impressions she sees over a period of a year or more) should be between 3X to 5X of the acquisition cost. The need is to keep a fine balance by less cost of acquisition and lesser number of ads.

c) Two to tango
While there have been many successful 'single person' newsletters, but usually it takes at least a two person team to coordinate between all the activities of content generation and curating, editing, reader acquisition and ads sales.

d) Subscriber growth should be the 'North Star'
The classic Chicken-and-Egg story also works in newsletter business and hence to achieve scale, the focus should always be ont he ways to increase subscriber base. Social Media is one of the option to do that.
