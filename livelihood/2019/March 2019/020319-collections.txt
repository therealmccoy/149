Growth Mindset, the revised version from Carol Dweck

Carol Dweck, the originator of the ‘Growth Mindset’ theory, analyses her work after many years, specially the way it has been implemented across the world and comes after the revision.

Growth mindset is not just about being persistent, it is also about trying new things and seeking feedbacks and input.

We all are a mix of ‘fixed’ and ‘growth’ mindset, and we need to accept this fact. There are always some challenges for which we are going to face ‘fixed mindset’. We need to work on those ‘triggers’.


2. Growth Mindset is as much ‘system’ oriented as it is ‘individual’ oriented

The Growth Mindset theory has been focussed on the ‘individual’, while the traits which makes or keeps a person ‘fixed’ is system or society oriented. While, working on an individual’s mindset can help that particular individual, it does not help to eradicate the disease.

Working on individual basis is a herculean task, while if the inherent structures of the system and society are tackled with a goal to bring in paradigm shift, it would help individuals en masse, overcome their ‘fixtures’.


3. Focus on building an ability, rather than boasting on ‘having one’

The first step towards building a growth mindset is to keep one’s focus on acquiring different abilities (like playing a musical instrument, or acquiring a skill like programming), rather than feeling pride on having an ability inherently (like, boasting on being a ‘natural born swimmer’).

The fact of matter is we take some activities like fish to water, while we struggle at some, because sub-consciously we believe that we have been born with those traits and those which we do not have, it is almost impossible to acquire them.

4. “Talent = Genes*(hard work + persistence)”

Growth Mindset has been taken as an universal one, like a fact. In truth, it is not and  there are other nuances which need to be considered.  Like external factors, which are beyond an individual’s control which hinders an individual’s ability to break the shackles.

The fact there are some element of genetics involved in a person’s mindset, can also be not completely negated or discounted.

The impact of the ‘way’ and ‘where’ the kids are brought also is not accounted for in the theory and hence a healthy disagreement is needed.

5. Nature v/s Nurture

Fixed v/s Growth mindset can be equalled to Nature v/s Nurture. 

When we advocate about ‘fixed’, we are giving the nature precedence. It’s like believing that we are born with a hard wired program, which cannot be altered.

When we believe in ‘growth’, we give ourselves a chance to overcome the ‘short-circuits’ of the nature through self ‘nurture’. When we explore our limits, we give nurture a chance, against nature.
