In this module, we have seen how the poor societies interact with the outside world or richer societies by the means of trade, capital and labour flows and how these external influences help or hinder them through their ascent through poverty.

Trade is the most important interface between poor and rich countries. Poor countries can use "Comparative Advantages" to their rescue in order to industrialise and enter the global market. There are international trade policies like "EBA - Everything But Arms" of European Union which help poorc countries achieve that and we also learnt how these policies differ and which one are the better ones.

We explored the "Intellectual Property Rights" and saw how the world has adopted the richest country system of intellectual property rights, that of America.

We also saw the complexity involved with a poor country owning natural resources and how it can be really a treacherous path to effectively harness it and put to good and effective use. Examples of Chile, Botswana and Sierra Leone.

Public and private capital flows is discussed within the rich and poor countries and how the public capital (Aid) has evolved the period of times from conditionality to building stronger institutions. How FDI not only brings money but also the most important "Organisation SKills" which the poor countries lack. The bad and ugly of private capital outflow in terms of corruption money and tax diversion going abroad in to safe havens.

The module also discusses the good and bad emigration and how the international refugee policy needs a re-think int erms of providing the refugees an opportunity to earn an livelihood and a more rigorous help to countries which pre-dominantly face refugee problem, being a safe haven.
