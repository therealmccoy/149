hi !
i am abhishek rai from India. I am a Hindu but a lot of my friends, right since childhood are Sikh.
A few months back, I stumbled on the Ms.Harshdeep Kaur rendtition of Mool Mantra and Jaap Sahib and it brought me so much peace and calm, that I started listening to it, every morning.
The learnings instilled in the Jaap Sahib are so invaluable, just like Gita, I believe the divine text shows us the right path to living this life.
Since then I wanted to dwell deep into it, but was never sure from where to start. Very fortunate to have stumbled on this course.
I intend to finish all the six religions offered in this HarvardX series, as part of my broad level of study and preparation to launch my own hedge fund. It's a 10 year project, so I believe I can dig deep in whatever fascinates me.
Thanks so very much to HarvardX, Professors and Instructors, for bringing this course alive.
regards
abhishek
